<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  A Carolina boy whose country at heart. Born and raised in a military family,
  traveled the world throughout my teenage and young adult years and finally got
  into IT where I still have a career as a Network and Security Consultant.
  Looking to learn programming and pivot into DevOps and see where this next
  journey of my life takes me.
