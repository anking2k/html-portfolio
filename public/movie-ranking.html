<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time are as follows...</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Armageddon</h3>
<p>Was in Taegu, South Korea in High School when this came out and it always brings back memories</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>First traffic ticket was because of those neon lights on my 95 Honda, but it set the trend at that time of my life</p>

<h3>Love and Basketball</h3>
<p>Creative way to tell a story and many of us could see ourselves in Omar Epp's shoes... espcially with Sanaa Lathan lol</p>
